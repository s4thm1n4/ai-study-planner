🔄 HOW TO SEE THE NEW ROADMAP UI 🔄

The code has been updated but your browser is showing the OLD cached version.

OPTION 1: HARD REFRESH (Recommended)
=====================================
Windows: Press Ctrl + Shift + R  (or Ctrl + F5)
Mac: Press Cmd + Shift + R

This forces browser to reload everything fresh.


OPTION 2: CLEAR BROWSER CACHE
==============================
Chrome/Edge:
1. Press F12 to open Developer Tools
2. Right-click the Refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

OR

1. Press Ctrl + Shift + Delete
2. Select "Cached images and files"
3. Click "Clear data"
4. Reload page


OPTION 3: OPEN IN INCOGNITO/PRIVATE MODE
=========================================
Chrome: Ctrl + Shift + N
Edge: Ctrl + Shift + P
Firefox: Ctrl + Shift + P

Then open: file:///C:/AI%20Study%20Planner/ai-study-planner/frontend/enhanced-index.html


OPTION 4: ADD URL PARAMETER
============================
Add ?v=2 to the end of URL:
file:///C:/AI%20Study%20Planner/ai-study-planner/frontend/enhanced-index.html?v=2


✅ WHAT YOU SHOULD SEE AFTER CLEARING CACHE:
============================================
1. 🗺️ "Your Learning Roadmap" heading (not "Study Schedule")
2. Zigzag layout with alternating left/right cards
3. Large circular markers with emojis (📖, ⚡, 🛠️, etc.)
4. Green vertical path line on the left
5. When you CLICK a day card → Popup flashcard with resources opens
6. When you CHECK a checkbox → Day turns green, path animates, auto-scrolls to next day


📝 HOW TO TEST:
==============
1. Open the page with hard refresh (Ctrl + Shift + R)
2. Scroll down to "AI Study Planner" section
3. Fill in: Subject, Hours, Days
4. Click "Generate Study Plan" button
5. You should see the NEW ROADMAP DESIGN

OR use demo mode:
1. Look for sample/demo results on page
2. Should show roadmap immediately


🐛 IF STILL SHOWING OLD UI:
===========================
Check browser console (F12):
- Should see: "🎯 Attaching roadmap event listeners..."
- Should see: "✅ Found 7 roadmap nodes to attach listeners"

If you DON'T see these messages:
- File is not reloaded properly
- Try INCOGNITO mode (guaranteed fresh)
