## üîç How to Test the "Analyze with AI" Button

### **Step 1: Log In First** üîê
The file analysis feature requires authentication.

1. Visit: http://localhost:8001/secure-auth.html
2. Register a new account OR log in with existing credentials
3. After successful login, you'll get a JWT token stored in localStorage

### **Step 2: Access File Analysis** üìÅ
Visit: http://localhost:8001/file-analysis.html

You should see:
- Upload limit display (showing "3 of 3 uploads remaining today")
- Drag & drop upload area
- Query input box
- Disabled "Analyze with AI" button (will enable after file selection)

### **Step 3: Upload a Test File** üìÑ

**Option A: Drag and Drop**
- Drag a PDF, PPTX, PNG, or JPG file onto the upload area
- File should appear in "Selected Files" section
- Button should become enabled

**Option B: Click to Browse**
- Click on the upload area
- Select a file from your computer
- File should appear in "Selected Files" section
- Button should become enabled

### **Step 4: (Optional) Add a Query** ‚úçÔ∏è
In the query box, type something like:
- "What are the main topics?"
- "Summarize this document"
- Leave blank for automatic summary

### **Step 5: Click "Analyze with AI"** üöÄ
1. Click the now-enabled "Analyze with AI" button
2. You should see:
   - Loading spinner appear
   - "Analyzing your file with AI..." message
   - Button becomes disabled during processing

3. After processing (5-15 seconds):
   - Results appear below
   - File icon, filename, and timestamp shown
   - AI analysis/summary displayed
   - Upload counter decreases (2 of 3 remaining)

## üêõ Debugging - Check Browser Console

I've added extensive debugging. Open Developer Tools (F12) and check the Console tab.

You should see logs like:
```
[DEBUG] Analyze button clicked
[DEBUG] Analyzing 1 file(s)
[DEBUG] Query: "No query - will summarize"
[DEBUG] Processing file: document.pdf (application/pdf, 52341 bytes)
[DEBUG] Sending request to http://localhost:8000/api/file-analysis/upload
[DEBUG] Response status: 200 OK
[DEBUG] Response data: {status: 'success', ...}
[DEBUG] Analysis successful!
```

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue 1: "Please log in to use this feature"**
- Solution: You're not logged in. Visit secure-auth.html first

**Issue 2: Button stays disabled**
- Check console for "[DEBUG] Files selected:" message
- If missing, file selection didn't work
- Try a different file or browser

**Issue 3: "Failed to analyze file"**
- Check console for error details
- Verify backend is running: http://127.0.0.1:8000
- Check if Gemini API key is valid in .env file

**Issue 4: CORS error**
- Backend should have CORS enabled (already configured)
- If issue persists, restart backend server

**Issue 5: "Daily upload limit reached"**
- Free plan allows 3 uploads per day
- Wait until tomorrow or test with premium features
- Or manually clear the database: delete `study_planner.db`

## üîß Backend Endpoint Testing

You can also test the API directly using curl or Postman:

### Get Upload Limit
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/file-analysis/check-limit" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

### Upload File
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/file-analysis/upload" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@path/to/your/file.pdf" \
  -F "query=What is this about?"
```

### Get History
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/file-analysis/history" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

## ‚úÖ Confirmation Checklist

Before reporting issues, verify:

- [ ] Backend server is running (http://127.0.0.1:8000)
- [ ] Frontend server is running (http://localhost:8001)
- [ ] You are logged in (check localStorage for 'authToken')
- [ ] File is valid format (PDF, PPTX, PNG, JPG)
- [ ] File size is reasonable (< 10MB)
- [ ] Browser console shows no red errors
- [ ] Gemini API key is configured in .env
- [ ] Daily upload limit not exceeded (check limit display)

## üéâ Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:
1. ‚úÖ Button becomes enabled after file selection
2. ‚úÖ Loading spinner appears when clicked
3. ‚úÖ Results appear with file icon and AI analysis
4. ‚úÖ Upload counter decreases (e.g., 3‚Üí2 remaining)
5. ‚úÖ Console shows successful debug messages
6. ‚úÖ No error alerts appear

---

## üÜò Still Not Working?

1. **Check Backend Logs:** Look at the PowerShell terminal running the backend
2. **Check Browser Console:** Look for [DEBUG] or [ERROR] messages
3. **Verify Authentication:** Check if localStorage has 'authToken' key
4. **Test Simple API:** Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ - should show API info
5. **Restart Everything:** Stop both servers, restart them

**Full Restart Command:**
```powershell
# Stop all servers (Ctrl+C in each terminal)
# Then restart:

# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd "c:\Users\HP\Desktop\AI Study Planner\ai-study-planner"
& "C:/Users/HP/Desktop/AI Study Planner/.venv/Scripts/python.exe" -m uvicorn backend.main:app --reload

# Terminal 2 - Frontend  
cd "c:\Users\HP\Desktop\AI Study Planner\ai-study-planner\frontend"
& "C:/Users/HP/Desktop/AI Study Planner/.venv/Scripts/python.exe" -m http.server 8001
```

## üìù Quick Test Script

Here's a quick JavaScript test you can run in the browser console on the file-analysis page:

```javascript
// Check if button exists
console.log('Button exists:', document.getElementById('analyzeBtn') !== null);

// Check if click handler is attached
console.log('Click handlers:', $0.onclick); // Click the button first

// Simulate file selection
const testFile = new File(["test content"], "test.txt", { type: "text/plain" });
handleFiles([testFile]);

// Check button state
console.log('Button disabled:', document.getElementById('analyzeBtn').disabled);
```
